# NIRScanNano_Api

Purpose of this project is to create simple REST API for accessing DLP NIR Scan Nano EVM module by Texas Instruments. By having this API we are abstracting USB communication and allowing us to create CLI tools and custom acquisition systems without relying on desktop application provided by the vendor.

Tools is developed and tested on Mac and Linux (Ubuntu).
